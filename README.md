# Structural-Defects-Network

This project demonstrates the process of identifying cracks in concrete images using convolutional neural networks. Specifically, I investigated the road pavement images using Structural Defects Network (SDNET) 2018 data provided by Utah State University. Itâ€™s an interesting research subject in the field of structural health monitoring. It helps the department of transportation and their pavement management system in their decision-making process, budget allocation, and prioritization for future maintenance or reconstruction activities.
This notebook is mainly comprised of four sections, EDA procedure, load datasets, model building and training, results and conclusions. I compared the performance of three different convolutional neural networks in the project.
The primary metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the model are accuracy and recall.
